 * Find min element present in stack
 * 
 * Problem Description
You are given to implement a stack which performs pushing, popping, and has a function findMin() which returns the minimum element present in the stack.

Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.


You will be given 3 types of queries. For each query you will be asked to perform suitable operations:

For query of type 1 x : push an element 'x' into the stack.

For query of type 2 : pop the last inserted element from the stack .

For query of type 3 : Find the minimum element from the stack. If the stack is empty, print -1.

Input format
First line contains an integer N denoting the number of queries.

For each query of type 1 there will be two integers 1 and x and for type 2 and 3 only single integers 2 or 3.

Output format
For each query of type 3. Print the minimum element in a new line.

Sample Input 1
6

1 2

1 3

1 1

3

2

3

Sample Output 1
1

2

Explanation 1
When we get to the query of type 3, the stack contains values 2, 3 and 1 (which were inserted with three queries of type 1 at the beginning) so the min element is 1. For the next query of type 3, the previous min element with value 1 has been popped (with the query type 2), so the remaining min element is 2.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5

0 <= A[i] <= 10^8 , 0<= i< N

public class MinStack {

	static Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
	static Stack<Integer> min = new Stack<Integer>();

	static void push(Integer e) {
		stack.push(e);

	static void pop() {
		if(!stack.isEmpty()) {

	}

	static Integer findMin() {
		if(stack.isEmpty()) {
			return -1;
		} else {
			Iterator<Integer> iterator = stack.iterator();
			int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
			while(iterator.hasNext()) {
				Integer next = iterator.next();
				if(next < min) {
					min = next;	
				}
			}
			return min;
		}
	}

	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		Integer n = sc.nextInt();
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
			Integer a = sc.nextInt();
			if (a == 1) {
				Integer e = sc.nextInt();
				push(e);
			}
			if (a == 2) {
				pop();
			}
			if (a == 3) {
				System.out.println(findMin());
